# Nguyễn Đức Huy - Not a Frontend Engineer

*Since I am not a frontend engineer, I'm not interested to build a fancy website. I just want to write some notes and share my knowledge with HR. I built my own from pure Markdown.*

## About me

I'm a backend engineer, also interested in deployment. I have been working with Python (mostly) for 3 years as a software engineer (including internships) and have 6 months of experience in a DevOps team. I have experience with Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD tools like Gitlab CI, and Github Actions, and Azure cloud service. I'm a quick learner and can work well under pressure. I'm also a good team player and can work well with others. Beside, I'm always willing to learn new things and improve my skills.
My most recent job was a software engineer and also a member of the DevOps team at [EAERA](https://eaera.com/). I'm looking for a new opportunity to work as a backend engineer, my main goal is to improve my skills and gain more experience in the field.
